**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Project Level:** 2
**Target Scale:** Medium project (10-20 stories)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **Attract clients** - Create an effective tool for attracting freelance projects and full-time positions
- **Professional positioning** - Demonstrate expertise as "a strong developer who will complete a project turnkey"
- **Memorable first impression** - Stand out among competitors with unique cyberpunk design and AI-video hero
- **International reach** - Ensure accessibility for Russian and English-speaking audiences

### Background Context

This project addresses the need for a professional online presence that effectively showcases technical expertise and attracts potential clients and employers. The current landscape of developer portfolios often lacks distinctive visual identity and fails to capture attention in the first few seconds.

Key insights from discovery:
- First impression is critical - hero section with AI-video and glitch effects creates immediate differentiation
- Cyberpunk aesthetic aligns with modern tech culture and creates memorable brand identity
- Bilingual support (RU/EN) is essential for targeting both local and international opportunities
- Static site architecture ensures fast loading, excellent SEO, and low maintenance costs

The project builds on completed brainstorming (SCAMPER session) and detailed technical specification, ready to move into implementation with clear feature priorities.

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: HR Manager Evaluating Candidate (Primary Use Case)

2. Hero section loads with AI-video and glitch effect - immediate visual impact
3. Reads positioning tagline: "Strong developer who delivers turnkey projects"
4. Scrolls down (snap-scroll) to About section - learns background in 30 seconds
5. Reviews Experience section - validates Yandex experience and achievements

## UX Design Principles

1. **First impression priority** - Hero section must immediately convey professionalism and creativity

3. **Cyberpunk aesthetic balance** - Effects enhance but don't distract from content readability
4. **Mobile-first approach** - Ensure excellent experience on mobile devices where many recruiters browse
5. **Accessibility respect** - Honor user preferences (reduced-motion, color contrast, keyboard navigation)

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly excluded from this project:**

- **Blog functionality** - Deferred to future phase, not needed for initial launch
- **Downloadable PDF resume** - May be added later, Telegram contact is primary CTA
- **Contact form** - Using Telegram button instead to reduce friction and avoid spam
- **Light theme toggle** - Dark cyberpunk theme only for MVP, light theme would dilute brand identity
- **Additional languages** - Only RU/EN supported, no other languages
- **Project case studies** - Brief project descriptions only, detailed case studies deferred
- **Animation customization** - Fixed animation set, no user controls for effects
- **Comments or guestbook** - Not a social platform, purely informational portfolio
- **Backend services** - Fully static site, no server-side logic or databases
- **Real-time features** - No live chat, notifications, or dynamic content updates

This scope ensures focused delivery of core value proposition within 3-week timeline while maintaining quality standards.
